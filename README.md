howtopuppet.com - FAQ site for Puppet and related technologies

Why
---

There's so much information out there about Puppet. And given how quickly the language has evolved over the
past few years, a lot of it is outdated, sub-optimal, or flat-out wrong with modern (let's say 3.x+) Puppet.
I'm not the most active member of #puppet or the mailing lists, but I try to keep up on what's going on. And
more and more, I see people asking the same questions, running into the same issues, and reproducing the same
anti-patterns. So, I figured that a nice, condensed place to store some pointers would be nice.

There are plenty of wonderful references out there about Puppet. Even though I've been using Puppet for a while,
when I type "d" into my browser URL bar, [docs.puppetlabs.com](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/) is usually the first
option. There's also a [Get Help](http://puppetlabs.com/community/get-help) page with links to great resources
such as the [puppet-users google group](http://groups.google.com/group/puppet-users), [FAQs](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/faq.html),
[#puppet](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=puppet) on Freenode, and the [ask.puppetlabs.com](http://ask.puppetlabs.com/)
Q&A site. This isn't intended to replace any of them. This is intended to be a curated, up-to-date, _linkable_
repository for common questions and explanations, errors, and patterns.

Who
---

I'm jantman pretty much everywhere including [GitHub](https://github.com/jantman) and often in #puppet on Freenode,
or [@j_antman on Twitter](https://twitter.com/j_antman). I also have a [blog](http://blog.jasonantman.com/) with a bunch
of tech info/tips/tutorials and an occasional rant or two.

But I'm just the guy who thought of registering a cool domain name and starting this site, mainly after I found myself
(during my occasional stints of trying to be active on #puppet or the puppet-users list) helping new Puppeteers along
with the same bits of information over and over.

I'm attempting to fill the site with some useful content to start with, but this is very much intended to be
a community project.
